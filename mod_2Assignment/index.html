            <h2 id="Chicken">Chicken</h2>
            <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food.</p>
