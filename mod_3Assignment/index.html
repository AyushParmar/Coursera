			Dosas
		</div>
		<p>
			A dosa is a rice pancake, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a common part of the diet in South India, but has become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar and chutney.
			Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars or saturated fats. As its key ingredients are rice and black gram, it is also a good source of protein. One home made plain dosa without oil contains about 112 calories, of which 84% is carbohydrate and 16% protein.The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content. There are instant mix products for making dosa which usually contain higher levels of rice.

			Changri malai curry
		</div>
		<p>
			Changri malai curry is the most famous Bangladesh curry dish based on coconut milk, and is revered throughout the region, including India.

			Chingri Malai (or Chingri Macher Malaikari as it is sometimes known), is a delicious creamy, satisfying seafood curry that is prepared by cooking prawns or shrimp in a coconut milk sauce with aromatic spices and served with basmati rice. Coconut milk is a very common ingredient in Bangladeshi cuisine, and this Changri Malai curry is a perfect example of that.

			The word Malai suggests the dish was actually brought to the region by Malaysian sailors docking at the Bay of Bengal many years ago, and the use of coconut in curries gives credence to this theory since it is popular in South-East Asian cuisine.

			Bangladeshi cooking is famed for its use of seafood and fish in curries, so Chingri malai is definitely a dish to try if youâ€™re ever in the region.
